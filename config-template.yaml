    # trims the RAM (working set) of the target process. although this can free
    # up lots of RAM for the trigger process, the target process will likely be
    # considerably slower for a while once resumed, regardless of whether the
    # trigger process used or benefited from the RAM.

    # if it was used to launch the trigger process, because this can mess the
    # trigger process up.

# will 'throttle' (e.g. suspend) whenever any trigger processes are running.
