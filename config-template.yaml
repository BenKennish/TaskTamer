    minimize: true

    trim_working_set: false
    # trims the RAM (working set) of the target process. although this can free
    # up lots of RAM for the trigger process, the target process will likely be
    # considerably slower for a while once resumed, regardless of whether the
    # trigger process used or benefited from the RAM.

    show_subtotal_only: true
    # when displaying table of information about target processes,
    # only show a subtotal for all target processes with the same name.

    is_launcher: false
    # any target process set as a launcher (e.g. Steam) will not be suspended
    # if it was used to launch the trigger process, because this can mess the
    # trigger process up.

# will 'throttle' (e.g. suspend) whenever any trigger processes are running.
# any default settings above can be overridden here
